# What is this?
A repository to host all files of course unit "Machine Learning".

# Project 
More information and dataset available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom
This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled
mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely
edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was
combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for
determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and
Ivy.

Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis;
Applied Machine Learning Methods (e.g., Classification, Regression, Clustering, etc.)
